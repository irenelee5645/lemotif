Lemotif generates a motif for your emotional life. You tell Lemotif a little bit about your day -- what were salient events or aspects and how they made you feel. Lemotif will generate a lemotif -- a creative abstract visual depiction of your emotions and their sources. Over time, Lemotif can create visual motifs to capture a summary of your emotional states over arbitrary periods of time -- making patterns in your emotions and their sources apparent, presenting opportunities to take actions, and measure their effectiveness.

## Future Directions

The current app is a very early proof-of-concept. Future directions include:
* Natural language processing of raw text journal input 
* Improving / adding visualizations
* Backend to support entry tracking over time
